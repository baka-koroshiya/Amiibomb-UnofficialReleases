# Amiibomb-UnofficialReleases
Amiibomb binary reposiotry for unofficial builds for helping the community test new patches 

# Test Release: 0.3 Alpha PATCH.1
  
Currently testing unofficial amiibomb 0.3 with the arduino "some ntags don't work" problem.  
  
The files are identical except the .HEX files for flashing Arduino from within the app.   
  
These .hex files were generated using AcK77's official INO file, but with updated MFRC522 library compiled in the Arduino IDE.
